**FIRST ATTEMPT**
-------------------
Animals are said to belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each other, giving birth to fertile offspring.
If they have a different species, there is still possibilities that they are tend to mate with each other.
Although their offspring are not fertile.

For example, horses and donkeys share many physical traits, but their offspring, called mules, are sterile.
That happens because mutations in donkey DNA can therefore never cross over to horses, or vice versa.

Unlike bulldog and a spaniel, they may look very different, but they are members of the same species, sharing the same DNA pool.
They will happily mate and their puppies will grow up to pair off with other dogs and produce more puppies.
